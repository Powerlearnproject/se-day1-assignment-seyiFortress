#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software enineering involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the evolution of software engineering milestones include the development of programming languages like Fortran and C,
the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, and
the advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
the phases of software development life cycle including:
Requirements; Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design; Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation; Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing; Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment; Releasing the software to users or customers and
Maintenance; Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodologies is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall such as; requirements, design and implementation phases.
agile methodologies are iterative and and an incremental approach focused on flexibility and collaboration, responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
in a software engineering team, software developers are responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
while a quality asurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
finally, a project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated development environments in the software development process are important because they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio and Sublime text.
version control systems in the software development process track changes to source code and coordinate work among team members e.g. Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
common challenges faced by software engineers include; Changing Requirements, Tight Deadlines, and Technical Debt.
strategies to overcome these challenges are; effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing individual components or modules of software is referred to as Unit Testing.
Testing interactions between different components or subsystems is referred to as Integration Testing.
Testing the entire software system as a whole is referred to as System Testing. while
Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs is referred to as Acceptance Testing.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
it is important because it helps avoid confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
for example; "discuss the evolution of footwears" is a vague prompt. to improve it, "review past literature on the evolution of men's casual footwears" has made it clear, specific, and concise.
this improved prompt is effective because it uses keywords that guide the AI towards the kind of response i want.
